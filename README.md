# meca3-example-gravity

Simulation of a field of bodies attracted to each other by the **newtonian gravity**.

The simulation represents the **earth-sun system** orbiting at an **accelerated speed**.

The points are initially in a **quasi-circular orbit** configuration with the **sun at center**.

In code, you can easily add more bodies in the system or change the mass, position and speed of both earth, sun.
